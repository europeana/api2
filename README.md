# Europeana: catalyst for change in the world of cultural heritage
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/europeana/api2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/europeana/api2)

## What does it do?

Europeana is an internet portal that acts as an interface to millions of books, paintings, films, museum objects and archival records that have been digitised throughout Europe. The API provides the machine interface for accessing these digital objects.

## Full Documentation

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/europeana/api2/wiki) for full documentation, examples, operational details and other information.

The JavaDoc will be generated once the upcoming code overhaul is complete.

## Communication

## Build

To build (requires the [CoreLib](https://github.com/europeana/corelib) dependency):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/europeana/api2.git
$ cd api2/
```

If your instance will be deployed, you need to copy the file

properties/test/template-europeana.properties -> properties/test/europeana.properties

and

template-manifest.yml -> manifest.yml

And make necessary changes

```bash
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

Futher details on building can be found on the [Deploy](https://github.com/europeana/api2/wiki/Deploy) page of the wiki (but check the [Setup](https://github.com/europeana/api2/wiki/Setup) first!.
